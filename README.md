# Unit 1: Project 1

## Overview
Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Key Topics
* Continuous integration
* Git branching workflow
* Agile software development
* JavScript
* JQuery
* Selenium Server

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is agile software development?
2. What is full-stack web development?
3. If you pull down a teammate's branch and you have merge conflicts, how do you handle it?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
* Explain agile software development
* Explain and implement unit tests
* How to interact with elements using WebDriverIO
* How to set up, create, and execute tests in WebDriverIO
